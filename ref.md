# References for README.md

### 1. Title

Thanks to @DenverCoder1's svg [repo](https://github.com/denvercoder1/readme-typing-svg) I could add this cool typewriter-effect text. Using the [Doto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Doto) font from Google Fonts. 

### 2. Comic book style illustration

Here I've combined a few different outputs from chatGPT (using the 4o model):

<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/v1.png"></td>
    <td><img src="images/v2.png"></td>
    <td><img src="images/v3.png"></td>
    <td><img src="images/v4.png"></td>
  </tr>
 </table>

Then since chatGPT could not change the aspect ratio, and got a few details wrong, I spent a few hours editing and combining the outputs on Procreate and Figma.

### 3. LinkedIn badge

Thanks to @badges' shields [repo](https://github.com/badges/shields) I could add this cool badge pointing to my LinkedIn page.
